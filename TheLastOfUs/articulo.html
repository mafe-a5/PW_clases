            You almost have to admire the hedonism of looking at The Last of Us Remastered, which is still
            visually impressive eight years later, and saying, “Yeah, that looks pretty good, but we can do
            better.” There’s very little left to be said about the original The Last of Us, a potent, postapocalyptic cocktail of stealth, survival, and slaughter that’s revered for its haunting storytelling
            in an amazingly well-crafted world. You almost certainly knew that. It’s widely lauded as one
            of the best games of all time and one of the few to get a 10 from IGN, but I reckon you knew
            that, too. In fact, it’s a game so nice they built it thrice, which is where we find ourselves with
            The Last of Us Part I – now the third version of Naughty Dog’s 2013 masterpiece to arrive
            inside a decade.

            Unsurprisingly, this remake takes full advantage of the added grunt afforded to it by the PS5 by
            delivering astonishing new levels of detail and fluidity in its fully rebuilt world, characters, and
            animations. It's also equipped with some subtle but well-considered use of the haptic feedback
            in the DualSense controller, and a simply remarkable array of accessibility options. It’s missing
            the original’s multiplayer mode, but the result is undoubtedly the definitive way for solo players
            to experience this modern classic. Even so, there is something inherently inessential about it that
            it can’t quite shake, as a remake of an already fabulous remaster that remains a must-play on
            hardware only a single generation old.

            It’s an absolutely top-shelf visual showcase of what the PlayStation 5 is capable of
        </i>
        <p>
            Make no mistake: the story here in both the main game and the short prequel, Left Behind
            (which is included in Part I, still as a separate story), remains as strong, as captivating, and as
            shocking as it ever was. If you’ve yet to play it, The Last of Us is a tangled bramble of themes,
            but Naughty Dog weaves them together expertly. It may trade in despair, selfishness, and
            misery, but it’s also quick to lightly breathe on the embers of hope, redemption, and love that
            glow within its darkness. The upshot is an unforgettable journey that I still can’t recommend
            highly enough.
